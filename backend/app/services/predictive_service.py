"""
Predictive service — dual-mode thermal load engine.

Occupancy model (feed-forward + feedback):
  - expected_occupancy → PLANNED headcount from Schedule/Reservation. Feed-forward
    signal: drives anticipatory pre-cooling, the only value known before arrival.
  - actual_occupancy   → REALIZED headcount inferred from CO2 (occupancy_service).
    Feedback signal: trims the demand once the room actually fills (or doesn't).
  The engine blends both into an effective_occupancy via FEEDBACK_WEIGHT.

Operates in two modes:
  - ML mode: loads a scikit-learn BUNDLE (model + feature contract + room_id map +
    metadata). Feature values are assembled by name from bundle["features"], so the
    row always matches the trained order. Available: temperature, hour_of_day,
    expected_occupancy, actual_occupancy, outdoor_temp (climate_service, Tier 2),
    floor/volume_m3/ac_btu (room_profile, Tier 3), plus room_code for legacy bundles.
    outdoor temp and room metadata need no hardware.
  - Heuristic mode (fallback): estimates thermal load as
    effective_occupancy × THERMAL_LOAD_PER_PERSON when no model.joblib is present.

The output drives the AC cognitive action: if the current temperature exceeds
the occupancy-adjusted target, the system emits ac_status=ON (PRE-COOLING);
otherwise it emits STANDBY, avoiding unnecessary energy consumption.
