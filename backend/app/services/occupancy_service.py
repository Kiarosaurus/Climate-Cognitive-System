Occupancy service — separates PLANNED occupancy from REALIZED occupancy.

The system distinguishes two occupancy signals that must never be conflated:

  - expected_occupancy  → PLANNED headcount, known ahead of time from the room's
    Schedule / Reservation. Drives FEED-FORWARD (anticipatory) pre-cooling: it is
    the only signal available *before* people arrive.

  - actual_occupancy    → REALIZED headcount, inferred in real time from the CO2
    sensor. Drives FEEDBACK (closed-loop) correction: if a room booked for 40 has
    only 5 people, CO2 stays low and the AC backs off, avoiding wasted energy.

Actual occupancy is estimated with a simple steady-state CO2 mass-balance proxy:

    people ≈ (co2_measured − co2_baseline) / co2_ppm_per_person

Both constants are calibratable. Defaults assume a naturally/lightly ventilated
classroom; recalibrate against a couple of manual headcounts for accuracy.

# Steady-state CO2 rise in ppm attributable to one additional occupant.
